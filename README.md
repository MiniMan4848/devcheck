# DevCheck

A discord bot i threw together to get details about a pump.fun dev from the contract address of one of their tokens - my first time webscraping.

## Environment Variables

Make a .env file and fill it in with the corresponding variables:

* `TOKEN` 
* `APP_ID` 
* `GUILD_ID`

## Dependencies

These are the following libraries needed to use DevCheck.

```
npm install discord.js
npm install dotenv
npm install puppeteer
npm install puppeteer-extra
npm install puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
```
and then run the following command to start the bot (ensure you have node.js)
```
